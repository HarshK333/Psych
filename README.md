The players are supposed to enter the game by inputting their name through the console. 
A set of questions are stored at the server. 
Each client is asked the same randomly chosen question selected from the server. 
Each client is to answer the question and the answers will be stored at the server. 
All the answers collected from each player are then sent to each player and the players choose the answer which they find best. 
They can choose any answer except for their own. 
A new client/player can be added at any time before the start of the game, but not in between a current round of the game. 
The answer that was selected most is calculated and the person who sent that answer is declared as the winner. 
The user can choose to enter the next round or leave the game room after the end of the current round.
